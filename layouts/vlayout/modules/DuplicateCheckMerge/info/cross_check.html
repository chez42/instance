<div class="dcm_option_type_info" style="padding: 10px; width: 700px;">
This will allow dupe check to check multiple modules for the same value, for example if i enter Organization name 'AAA' - it will check account.accountname AND lead.company AND contact.cf_xxx to see if same value exists - if it does - then show that in the popup of duplicates. (show label as we do now).
