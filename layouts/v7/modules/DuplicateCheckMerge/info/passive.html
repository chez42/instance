Passive (Clicking the Icon) - allows users to manually check for potential duplicates. Unlike "Real Time(Opening the Record)", this one does not query database right away, the user has to click on the "Icon" to initiate the query. It's helpful for big databases to avoid latency issues. If the duplicates are found - it will show warning icon which can be clicked and potential duplicates will be displayed. In a case where there are no duplicates - the green checkbox icon will show up indicating no duplicates.
