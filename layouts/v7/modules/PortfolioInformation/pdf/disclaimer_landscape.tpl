    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Flow/Net Contributions</strong><br />
        The net amount of all capital flows to and from your portfolio during the time period. Capital flows include deposits and withdrawals of cash and receipts and transfers of securities.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Income</strong><br />
        The total of all interest and dividend income earned in your portfolio during the time period.
    </p>

    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>TWR/Time Weighted (net)</strong><br />
        The percentage rate of return earned by your portfolio during the time period. The return reflects the aggregate performance of your portfolio’s underlying investments due to income received and price changes during the time period. The return is unaffected by decisions to deposit or withdraw cash and securities and is useful to compare against the return of market indexes during the same time period.
    </p>

    <p>
        TWR calculation based on account transactions between the specified dates using <strong>daily</strong> begin and end value intervals.<br />
        Daily interval calculations provide the best accuracy to the TWR performance over monthly due to price fluxuations against the date of flows.<br />
        A deposit at the beginning of the month would have the same effect as a deposit at the end of the month using monthly, but would imediately take effect in daily.<br />
        TWR formula is as follows:<br />
        Holding Period = ((Interval End Value - (Flows) - IntervalBeginValue) / IntervalBeginValue + NetFlowAmount) + 1
        TWR = ((Holding Period_1 x Holding Period_2 x ... x Holding Period_n) - 1) * 100
